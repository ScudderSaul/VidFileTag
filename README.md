# VidFileTag
File Tagging for media files application

VidFileTag is a program that is used to add tags to a database describing media files of many kinds, images, music, and video. 
It maintains all tag information in a local database and never modifies the media files. 
Operations like copying all files tagged with a particualar tag to a location, or saving a playlist of files with a selected set of tags are available. 
Tagging copies of files tagged in another location is another job the VidFileTag performs. 
VidFileTag has a media player to allow viewing or listening to media file to help chose tags. 
The VideoLan.LibVLC.Windows media library is used to build the media player.
